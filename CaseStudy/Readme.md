### DESCRIPTION
:point_right: The above block diagram is the representation of a simple Line following robot.</br>

:point_right: The line following robot consists of two IR sensors, two color sensors TCS230, Arduino Uno as a Microcontroller, dc motors.</br>

:point_right: IR sensors are used to detect the heat or detects the motion and it is one of the important sensor for a simple line following robot.</br>

:point_right: Color sensors(TCS 230) are used to detect and measure almost an infinite range of visible colors and in this robot it is mainly used to detect white and black coloured path.</br>

:point_right: Arduino Uno which is a programmable microcontroller board is used to control the entire motion of the robot by the help of program which could be compiled and run by the Arduino IDE.</br>

:point_right: The robot follows the given predefined path and the line is indicated by the help of black color line with white as a background or white as a contrast.

This is a brief description about the first case study which is Line following robot.



# CASE STUDY 2
## TWO WHEELED SELF BALANCING ROBOT

### DESCRIPTION

:dart: The robot consists of sensor, Motors, Motor Driver and Microcontroller.

#### SENSOR
:dart: The sensors used are accelerometer and gyroscope sensor which is collectively called MPU6050 and are used to maintain and balance the positiom.

#### MOTORS
:dart: The motors are used in the rotation of wheels and for motion of the robot.

#### MOTOR DRIVER
:dart: The motor drivers are used to control the speed of motors and are very much helpful in maintaining the balance of the robot.

#### MICROCONTROLLER
:dart: The microcontroller used is Arduino Uno where the robot is completely controlled from balancing to the controlled motion of the robot so that the robot is balanced position and the program is written in such a way that the robot automatically gets balanced and makes sure that it doesn't lose the balance.

#### APPLICATION
* One of the most general purpose application is it carries payload from one end to the other end.</br>
* The self balancing robot can also be used as medium of transportation.
